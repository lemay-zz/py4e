# py4e-exercices

This is where I leave traces of my apprentice as an humble Python dev. Learning is living. I'm following the friendly voice of Charles Severance (py4e.com). Seems to me like a great guy. Love the share that knowledge approach. If you're new to Python or programming, get his (free) book. This is a great starter : Python for Everybody, exploring data in python3.
